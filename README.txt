1. Please keep both TestScript and TestSrc folders. They are for running testing script for programming assignments.

2. Write unit test cases in *Test.java {i.e. AdjacentPrimeTest.java} and upload to ~/TestBashShell

3. For running test on programming assignments, modify the testScript.sh with two positional parrameters - assign{1,2,3,4,5} and the name of test class {i.e. AdjacentPrime}

4. Run ./test.sh

5.PassTheTest.txt will have all students whose program passed all tests. NotPassTheTest.txt will have all students whose program failed upon at least 1 test case.

6. More details are available in log.txt.

Happy Coding :-)
